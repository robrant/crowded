Need to work out if there is a way of uniquely hashing the images from TFL so that they don't get repeated.
The problem is this: when crowded goes to cams and gets the latest images, there is nothing from stopping it 
getting the same image as previously fetched (if the image hasn't changed). Thus we get duplicate images in 
crowded and it fills it up.

Best thing is to investigate the dates being published in tfl to see whether one of the dates reflects the 
time of last update. If it does, then bring that through in the document to crowded and maybe even use that
as the datetime that is incorporated into the image file names. With that, you can search for it in the list
of dicts and only populate the event document if it isn't in there.

Need to write a twitter broker web service that accepts a GET request from crowded, which sets up a
hub of the subs collection. It then does its own periodic checking of that hub and polls twitter search api
accordingly. The responses are then either polled from crowded or better still, they are POSTed into 
crowded by the twitter

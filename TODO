Do they have a geospatial API?

4.

Expand the remit. What other contextual info would be useful?
a. The tweets themselves? - DYNAMIC
b. What is nearby? - foursquares geo api, wikipedia geo API, infochimps api? - RELATIVELY STATIC AND MAP BASED
c. Who is nearby? - tweets, instagram users, check ins on four squares for witnesses, etc. - DYNAMIC
d. cell towers - open cell ID  - RELATIVELY STATIC AND MAP BASED
e. Maps - google, satellite, open street map - See keynotes slides.

Agree on standards for json exchange

6. 
Remove unsafe json lists from services

7. Add authentication - maybe in move to Django

8. ERROR LOGGING!

9. Ability for users to remove images - from the total queue or just from theirs?
   Probably best to remove them from the total queue - present a filtered and non-fitlered page
   Button next to the main image that they can click, which adds a 'vetted' boolean
   to the media document.
